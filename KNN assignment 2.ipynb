    "Ans: The Euclidean distance is the straight-line distance between two points in a Euclidean space. It is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squared differences between the coordinates of two points. This metric is sensitive to the scale of the features and the orientation of the coordinate axes.\n",

    "The Manhattan distance, also known as the city block distance or L1 norm, is the sum of the absolute differences between the coordinates of two points.

    "Ans: Choosing the optimal value of k in a K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is an important task, as it can significantly affect the performance of the model. Here are some techniques that can be used to determine the optimal k value:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid Search: One common approach to finding the optimal k value is to use grid search. In this technique, the model is trained and evaluated for different values of k, and the k value that gives the best performance is selected. Typically, a range of k values is specified and a cross-validation procedure is used to evaluate each value of k.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-Validation: Another approach is to use k-fold cross-validation. In this technique, the data is split into k equally sized folds, and the model is trained and evaluated k times, each time using a different fold as the validation set and the remaining folds as the training set. The k value that gives the best average performance across the k iterations is selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Elbow Method: The elbow method is a graphical technique that can be used to determine the optimal k value. In this technique, the performance of the model is plotted against different k values, and the plot is examined for the point where the performance stops improving significantly. This point is called the \"elbow\", and the k value at the elbow can be chosen as the optimal k value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Distance Metrics: The optimal k value can also depend on the distance metric used. For example, using the Euclidean distance metric may lead to different optimal k values than using the Manhattan distance metric. Therefore, it is important to experiment with different distance metrics and evaluate the performance of the model for different k values.Ans: "

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensitivity to Scale: The Euclidean distance metric is sensitive to the scale of the features, while the Manhattan distance metric is not.
